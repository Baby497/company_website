    "use this text if we want more detail": "We use a priority rating system to assign time-slots to the students who want that slot the most. Each student begins with an equal amount of tokens. Students will use tokens to \"Bid\" for the company time-slots that they want the most. There are three rounds of bidding for all companies, so students who miss out on the slots they want during one round can try again on the next round. After bidding is over, students are assigned slots and any remaining slots are first-come-first-serve sign up through our platform."
